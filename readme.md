# Welcome to YLYL-Downloader!

This tool allows for automated download and playlist creation for VLC. This solved issues like login prompts and cookie prompts from skipping the beginning of videos ruining short form memes. It utilizes yt-dlp behind the scenes to download the videos.

# Installation

To start you can run YLYL-Downloader.exe or you can download the .zip version and extract it to a folder

# Troubleshooting

I will attempt to let you know if you need browser cookies to download certain items, however if you see errors on some unlisted,  private links or age gated links you will need to use the *Use Cookies* check box.

# Using

To get started you will need a text file with 1 url per line, it does not matter where they come from as long as its supported by yt-dlp [Supported Sites](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md). If you need a playlist select *Make playlist* that will take all the content in the order shown in the file into a VLC playable file called output_playlist.xspf in the Folder selected by default INSTALLPATH\Downloads\


# TODO

1. Show how many videos are in a playlist in bottom of program
2. Dynamically show output length on bottom
3. Speed up
4. Allow selecting a specific format to remux to
